### Tools Inventory:
**Phase 1 (10 tools)**: network-scanner, port-scanner, service-fingerprinter, web-directory-enumerator, credential-validator, dns-enumerator, smb-enumerator, http-request-tool, hash-cracker, reverse-shell-handler

**Phase 2 (5 tools)**: payload-generator, process-hollowing, amsi-bypass, shellcode-encoder, edr-evasion-toolkit
### Blockers/Issues:
- None
### Next Steps:
- Available for additional tool development if requested
- Standby for defensive tool requirements

---

## QA Tester Agent
### Status: ACTIVE - PRIORITY
### Current Task:
Testing expansion sprint - executing comprehensive test suites, fuzz testing, and lint compliance verification.
### Test Metrics:
| Category | Files | Tests |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Unit Tests (tools/) | 15 | 300+ |
| Unit Tests (tests/) | 19 | 650+ |
| Fuzz Tests | 4 | 56+ |
| Integration Tests | 1 | 6+ |
| **TOTAL** | **37** | **1,102** |

### Fuzz Test Files:
- `/Users/ic/cptc11/python/tests/fuzz/test_fuzz_network_inputs.py`
- `/Users/ic/cptc11/python/tests/fuzz/test_fuzz_port_inputs.py`
- `/Users/ic/cptc11/python/tests/fuzz/test_fuzz_url_inputs.py`

### Completed This Period:
- Verified test infrastructure integrity
- Confirmed 37 test files with 1,102 test functions
- Fuzz testing using Hypothesis for property-based testing
### Blockers/Issues:
- None identified
### Next Steps:
- Continue test execution
- Target 80% coverage across all tools
- Expand fuzz test coverage

---

## Docker Test Env Builder Agent
### Status: STANDBY
### Current Task:
Awaiting environment creation requests for offensive tool testing.
### Configuration:
- Agent configured at `.claude/agents/docker-test-env-builder.md`
- Target directory: `cptc11/environments/`
### Capabilities:
- Docker Compose environment creation
- Multi-container network topologies
- Vulnerable service configurations
- Network segmentation (DMZ, internal, management)
### Next Steps:
- Create testing environments for Phase 1 tools
- Build SMB/HTTP/DNS test targets

---

## YARA Detection Engineer Agent
### Status: STANDBY
### Current Task:
Awaiting trigger to begin detection rule development for offensive tools.
### Configuration:
- Agent configured at `.claude/agents/yara-detection-engineer.md`
- Target directory: `detection/yara/`
- 15-minute iteration cycle planned
### Detection Targets:
- 15 offensive tools requiring YARA signatures
- Focus on static analysis indicators
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
### Next Steps:
- Begin analysis of Phase 1 tools
- Develop initial detection rules
- Create testing fixtures

---

## Documentation Agent
### Status: Not Configured
### Documentation Coverage:
- Python-to-Golang work: Documented (converter_report.md)
- Toolsmith work: Documented (toolsmith_report.md)
- Testing work: Documented in PROJECT_STATUS.md
### Outstanding Documentation Needs:
- Docker environment documentation (pending creation)
- YARA rules documentation (pending development)
- CI/CD pipeline documentation

---

## Cross-Agent Coordination Notes

### New Sprint Dependencies
```
Testing Expansion --> Docker Environments --> Tool Testing
                  --> YARA Rules --> Detection Coverage
```

### Agent Activation Priority
1. **QA Tester Agent** - Continue active testing (RUNNING)
2. **Docker Test Env Builder** - Activate when test environments needed
3. **YARA Detection Engineer** - Activate for defensive coverage
4. **DevOps CI/CD Integrator** - Activate for pipeline setup

### Inter-Agent Communication
- All agents write reports to `/Users/ic/cptc11/agent_reports/`
- GitHub sync every 15 minutes
- Project Coordinator monitors all agent activity

---

## Action Items for Next Period
1. **PRIORITY**: Continue test execution and coverage expansion
2. Prepare first Docker environment for network-scanner testing
3. Begin YARA rule development for Phase 1 tools
4. Monitor test results and document any failures
5. Prepare next GitHub sync commit summary

---

## GitHub Sync - Commit Summary

### Files Modified This Period:
- `/Users/ic/cptc11/agent_reports/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Updated with new sprint info
- `/Users/ic/cptc11/agent_reports/report_2026-01-10_20-15.md` - New coordination report

### Commit Message Suggestion:
```
[Sprint Update] Testing expansion, Docker envs, YARA rules

- New sprint: Testing Expansion, Docker Environments, Defensive Tools, YARA Rules
- Test metrics: 37 files, 1,102 test functions confirmed
- Docker Test Env Builder agent configured
- YARA Detection Engineer agent configured
- Coverage estimates updated (70% current, 80% target)
- All 15 tools and 10 Golang conversions remain complete
```

---

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Test coverage below 80% target | Medium | Prioritize QA Tester Agent, expand fuzz tests |
| Docker environments not yet created | Low | Docker Test Env Builder on standby, ready to activate |
| YARA rules not yet developed | Low | YARA Detection Engineer configured, pending activation |
| Documentation Agent not configured | Low | Manual documentation being maintained |

---

## Next Report
**Scheduled**: 2026-01-10T20:35:00Z
**Focus**: Test execution results, Docker environment progress, YARA rule development status
